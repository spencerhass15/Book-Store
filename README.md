# Book Store

Users who visit your book store signin, search for books, select books and view detailed book information. They can also save books to three different lists or “shelves”:

“Want to Read”
“Currently Reading”
“Read”
Together, these shelves will make up their “bookshelf”. You will include functionality for users to manage the contents of their bookshelves.
